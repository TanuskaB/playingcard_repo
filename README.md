Team Collaboration Exercise
This is a team-based assignment! You will complete this exercise with your project group partners. Refer to the Project Group Listing to identify your team members. This task emphasizes GitHub collaboration and version control practices.

In this Inclass Activity, you will download a starter HTML file and modify its embedded stylesheet to create a realistic "card table" scene. You will position two playing cards precisely on a green felt-like background using CSS.

The Goal: Create a webpage that displays two playing cards (one red heart, one black spade) on a green gradient background. The cards must be positioned absolutely relative to the table container.
